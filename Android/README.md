## Android SDK Usage Overview

### Android integration

#### Download Xfers Android SDK

1. In your Android project's `build.gradle`, add the following repository:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/xfers/xfers-android' }
    }
}
```

2. In your App project's `build.gradle`, add the following dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.xfers.xfers_sdk:xfers_sdk:0.1.4"
}
```

3. Sync gradle

You have now successfully downloaded and added the Xfers Android SDK to your app.

#### Set up your merchant specific settings

You will need the following in order to successfully integrate with Xfers Android SDK:

1. Merchant name - the name that you prefer to be addressed by through the SDK, for e.g. Xfers.
1. Merchant logo - the logo that you prefer to have displayed when we refer to you through the SDK, for e.g. the Xfers logo.
1. Merchant logo's tint - the tint of your logo that you prefer to have displayed when we refer to you through the SDK, for e.g. the Xfers logo's blue.
1. Merchant's api_base - the base url of your backend server, we will be sending HTTP requests to this server during the authentication phase, see `Backend integration` for more information as to how to set up this backend server.

To set up the above details, in your main activity, add the following code into the `onCreate` method:

### Sample Java code
```Java
// Put your Base URL here, this is the Base URL that we will call for Connect flow, for e.g.
// https://bright-sunshine-91728.herokuapp.com/
private String merchantApiBase = "<set_your_backend_api_base_here>";

// Put your name here, this is the name that we will use to refer to you in the SDK, for e.g.
// Best Merchant
private String merchantName = "<set_your_name_here>";

// Put your logo source here, this is the image that we will use to refer to you in the SDK, for e.g.
// R.drawable.your_logo
private int merchantLogo = R.drawable.ic_launcher_foreground;

// Put your logo tint here, this is the color that we will use to tint your logo in the SDK, for e.g.
// R.color.your_color
private int merchantLogoTint = Color.BLACK;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    Xfers xfers = new Xfers(this); // this here refers to the Context

    xfers.getConfig().setSDKConfigurations(Xfers.Country.ID, Xfers.Environment.SANDBOX);
    xfers.getConfig().setMerchantConfigurations(merchantApiBase, merchantName, merchantLogo, merchantLogoTint);
    
    // Un comment this to start a flow.
    // xfers.getFlow().startTopupFlow();
}
```

*** NOTE: It is recommended that you first try to integrate with SANDBOX before trying to integrate with PRODUCTION.

At this point, you are ready to start calling features from the Xfers SDK.

#### Features of Xfers SDK

* When you call any of these methods, we will present a new activity on top of `this` where `this` being the context that you initialised the `Xfers` object with, such as your `MainActivity`.

* Note that some of the flows and UI are still currently under construction and you will see the following UI:

This does not mean that you have integrated the SDK wrongly, in fact, this means that you have integrated the SDK correctly and the feature will be live in a soon-to-be-coming update to the SDK!

##### Flows

* NOTE: The only flow that does not require a `user_api_key` to be supplied to work is the `Xfers Connect Flow`, that is the flow which after being set up, will supply you with a `user_api_key` that can be used to perform interactions between you (the Merchant) and your user (the user). Please refer to the section on `Setting up the Xfers Connect Flow` for more detailed explanation on how to integrate the connect flow and get the user's `user_api_key`.

1. Xfers Connect Flow

This is the flow that you'll integrate with in order to get the user's `user_api_key` in order to initiate the other flows.

```Java
new Xfers(this).flow.startConnectFlow();
```

### Backend integration

Example backend (PHP):

1. Install the xfers-php SDK from https://github.com/Xfers/xfers-php
2. Set up 2 post routes with the following specifications on your PHP backend:

- First POST route should point to `base_url/signup_login`, this will be used to send the OTP to the user which will be used to get the `user_api_key`

```php
<?php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

\Xfers\Xfers::setIDSandbox();
$xfers_app_api_key = '<your_actual_app_api_key>';
try {
    $resp = \Xfers\Connect::authorize(array(
        'phone_no' => '<user_phone_number>', // the phone number will be in the params that we send via the POST request, i.e. params['phoneNumber']
        'signature' => '178502abfa891b69a9a2f72192d51f5fc141f978' // this should be a SHA1-hex of (phone_no + APP_SECRET_KEY)
    ), $xfers_app_api_key);

    print_r($resp);

    $data = [ 'msg' => 'success' ];

    header('Content-type: application/json');
    echo json_encode( $data ); // you must echo this back so that our Android SDK will know that it is a successful operation and continue
} catch (\Xfers\Error\Api $e) {
    echo 'Caught Api exception: ', $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
php>
```

- Second POST route should point to `base_url/get_token`, this will be used to authenticate the OTP sent in the previous route to dispense the `user_api_key`

```php
<?php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

\Xfers\Xfers::setIDSandbox();
$xfers_app_api_key = '<your_actual_app_api_key>';
try {
    $resp = \Xfers\Connect::getToken(array(
        'otp' => '123456', // the OTP will be in the params that we send via the POST request, i.e. params['OTP']
        'phone_no' => '<user_phone_number>', // the phone number should be provided by you from your server, you will need to tag the `user_api_key` to the number
        'signature' => '178502abfa891b69a9a2f72192d51f5fc141f978', // this should be a SHA1-hex of (phone_no + APP_SECRET_KEY)
    ), $xfers_app_api_key);
    print_r($resp);

    $user_api_token = $resp['user_api_token'];

    // NOTE: You have to remember the `user_api_token`, tagging it to the user's phone_no as you can use the `user_api_token` to initialise the Android SDK in the future without having the user go through the Connect flow again

    $data = [ 'apiKey' => $user_api_token ];

    header('Content-type: application/json');
    echo json_encode( $data ); // you must echo this back so that the Android SDK will be able to securely store the `user_api_key` and continue
} catch (\Xfers\Error\Api $e) {
    echo 'Caught Api exception: ', $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
php>
```

### Setting up the Xfers Connect Flow (Without the user's `apiKey`)

1. The only thing you need to do is to start the connect flow on the Android SDK on an Activity of your choice:

```java
new Xfers(this).startConnectFlow();
```

* NOTE: You must have supplied a `merchantApiBase` in order for this to work

Part 1:

- Your user will be prompted to key in their phone number, once the user has entered their phone number, the SDK will proceed to call the url `merchantApiBase/signup_login`, it has to be set up as in the above under "Backend Integration"

- The SDK will call the url with the following format: `{"phoneNumber":"<a_phone_number>"`

- Your POST API should echo a JSON with the following format `{"msg":"success"}` upon a successful creation of the user on Xfers

- Your user will also receive an OTP to the phone number that they have entered

Part 2:

- Your user will be prompted to key in the OTP that they have received, once the user has entered the OTP, the SDK will proceed to call the url `merchantApiBase/get_token`, it has to be set up as in the above under "Backend Integration"

- The SDK will call the url with the following format: `{"OTP":"<an_OTP>"`

- Your POST API should echo a JSON with the following format `{"apiKey":"<an_api_key>"}` upon a successful authentication of the OTP

* NOTE: You should save the `apiKey` on your backend tagged to the number as it can be used to initialise the SDK the next time without having the user go through the entire connect flow again, refer to "Initialising the Xfers SDK (With the user's `apiKey`) for more information

After this is set up, you can call any of the other flows and UI to interact with the user's Xfers account.

### Initilisaing the Xfers SDK (With the user's `apiKey`)

If you have already connected with the user before through the section "Setting up the Xfers Connect Flow" and have the user's `apiKey` in your server, you can query your own server the `apiKey` and call the following command to have the SDK initialised:

```java
new Xfers(this).config.setUserApiKey("<the_user_api_key>");
```

Once you have set this up,  you can call any of the other flows and UI to interact with the user's Xfers account.
